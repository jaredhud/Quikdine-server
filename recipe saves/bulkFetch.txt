        "Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon Blanc are my top picks for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Bodegan Aniello 006 Pinot Noir with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.",

        "Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon Blanc are great choices for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Bodegan Aniello 006 Pinot Noir with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.",

          description:
            "Deep purple in color, Sodale is redolant with inky black fruit, sweet spice, and mineral- all of which are woven together tighlty with a degree ofÂ finesse that calls its revered cousin, Montiano, to mind. On the palate the wine is juicy yet structured with abundant tannin that is polished and supple in texture.Â A balanced finish of medium length begs another sip and makes Sodale an indespensable everyday drinker.Pair Sodale with your mid-week supper, or a more carefully coordinated affair.Â A stuffed portobello mushroom, a slow-cooked Bolognese sauce, or a seared shell steak with frites and a red wine reduction would all pair beautifully with Sodale.",
