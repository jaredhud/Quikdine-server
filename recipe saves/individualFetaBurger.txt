      "Merlot, Malbec, and Zinfandel are great choices for Burger. Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel. The Northstar Columbia Valley Merlot with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 40 dollars per bottle.",

        description:
          "Power and finesse come to mind when tasting this wine. Big structure with smooth tannins and beautiful oak flavors in the finish. Ripe plum and concentrated dark ripe fruit such as raspberry, blackberry and cherry explode in the mouth. Building on Washington state's penchant for Merlots with rich, supple texture, depth and structure, Northstar produced its first wine in 1994. Ours is an on-going exploration of Washington's star grape variety. Quantities are extremely limited, but if you love Merlot, we think you'll find this wine worth seeking.",
